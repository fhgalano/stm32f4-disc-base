# `STM32F4 Extended Usb Example`

This is based off the cortex-m rust template. It's just a base template to use in the future when I start embedded projects in
Rust on the STM32F407-DISCOVERY Board.

This example is nice since it sets up typical clock configurations, GPIO, Interrupts, several timers, and USB-HID
